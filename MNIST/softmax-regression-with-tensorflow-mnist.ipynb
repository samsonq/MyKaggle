In this problem, we have to classify a number, given the pixels. We are given a data set with pixels at different locations of the entire grid of the number. This is known as a Deep Learning problem, a more advanced application of Machine Learning. In this kernel, we will build a TensorFlow Softmax Regression model with a SGD optimizer to help us with the classification. \n\nBefore we get started, however, you should know the basics of Machine Learning beforehand. TensorFlow has a larger library than sklearn and is more complicated to use. Be sure to read my kernel on [regression](https://www.kaggle.com/samsonqian/predicting-house-prices-with-regression) and [classification](https://www.kaggle.com/samsonqian/titanic-guide-with-sklearn-and-eda) before this one!\n\n*Please upvote if this kernel helps you! Feel free to fork this notebook to play with the code yourself.* If you may have any questions about the code, or any step of the process, please comment and I will clear up any confusion."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"20947bea525940f546092ea6b66796119133ca99"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Contents\n1.
